PLA testbed has been modified for a more snug press-fit of the servos into it. 2-part servo horns were designed, containing a snapping clip at the end that was supposed to hold each of fins on either side of the ripple bot. The swiveling clip design proved to be less than ideal. We moved to a single piece horn design, printed in TPU. This allows for the end of the horn to flex and bend with either fin as necessary.
